# How to Spot Garage Door Issues Before Buying a Home

A garage door is one of the largest moving parts in a home—and one of the most overlooked during the buying process. While a home inspection may cover the basics, it’s smart to know what to look for yourself so you can avoid surprise repair bills after you move in.

Here’s a quick checklist to help you spot potential garage door issues before you sign on the dotted line.

---

## **1. Look for Visible Wear and Damage**
Walk around the door and check for:
- Dents, cracks, or warping in the panels
- Rust spots on steel doors
- Rot or peeling paint on wooden doors
- Gaps along the edges that could let in pests or weather

These can be signs of neglect, poor maintenance, or previous damage.

---

## **2. Test the Door’s Movement**
Ask the current owner or agent to operate the door while you watch. Look for:
- Jerky or uneven movement
- Excessive shaking or rattling
- The door stopping before it’s fully open or closed

A smooth, quiet operation is a good sign. Anything else could mean worn rollers, bent tracks, or opener problems.

---

## **3. Listen for Unusual Noises**
Grinding, squealing, or loud banging sounds often mean parts are worn or in need of lubrication. While some noise issues are minor fixes, others can indicate more expensive repairs.

---

## **4. Inspect the Springs and Cables**
Without touching them (for safety), visually check:
- Springs for rust, gaps, or stretching
- Cables for fraying or corrosion

If these parts fail, the door may become unsafe to use—and repairs can be costly.

---

## **5. Check Safety Features**
Modern garage doors should have:
- **Photo-eye sensors** near the floor on each side of the door
- **Auto-reverse function** that stops and reverses if the door meets resistance

If these aren’t present or aren’t working, it’s both a safety and a negotiation point.

---

## **6. Look at the Opener**
See if the opener:
- Responds quickly to the remote or wall button
- Has a backup battery (for newer models)
- Shows signs of age or exposed wiring

Older openers may lack modern safety and security features like rolling code technology.

---

## **7. Ask About Maintenance History**
A well-maintained door can last decades. Ask the seller:
- When was the last tune-up?
- Has the door ever been replaced?
- Were major parts like springs or the opener recently serviced?

---

## **Bottom Line**
The garage door might not be the first thing you think about when touring a home—but it should be on your radar. Catching issues early can help you budget for repairs, negotiate a better price, or avoid a costly surprise.
