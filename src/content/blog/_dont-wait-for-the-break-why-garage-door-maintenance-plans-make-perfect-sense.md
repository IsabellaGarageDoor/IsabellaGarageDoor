# Why Performance Membership Is the Smartest Investment for Your Garage Door

Most homeowners treat their garage door like their HVAC system or water heater—something to ignore until it stops working. Then comes the panic: a door stuck open in winter, a broken spring on your way to work, or a safety hazard you didn't see coming.

**Performance Membership flips that entire model.**

For $49 a month, you get something most service industries don't offer: true peace of mind. Not a discount card. Not a maintenance reminder system. An actual *care program* designed so you never have to think about your garage door again.

## What "Never Worry Again" Actually Means

This isn't marketing language. It's a literal promise.

As long as your membership is active and in good standing, you never pay for the parts that wear out naturally. Springs, rollers, cables, hinges, bearings—the components that fail on every garage door eventually—are covered. Parts *and* labor.

You're not buying a warranty. You're enrolling in a system where failure is handled automatically, before it becomes your problem.

## What You Get: Proactive Care, Not Reactive Service

### 🛠️ Biannual Performance Tuning

Twice a year, your door gets a full inspection, safety test, lubrication, and precision adjustment. Every visit is documented so we're tracking the health of your system over time—not just fixing what's broken today.

### 🔋 Batteries & Light Bulbs Replaced Automatically

During your spring visit, we swap out keypad batteries and opener light bulbs. Small details, but they keep your system ready to use without you having to remember or plan anything.

### 🛡️ Lifetime Wear Coverage

Failed high-cycle springs? Worn nylon rollers? Frayed lift cables? Covered. This is the core value: the expensive, inevitable failures are handled without a service call, without an invoice, without interrupting your day.

### 🚀 VIP Priority Scheduling

Something feels off between visits? Text us. Members get front-of-the-line scheduling. You're not waiting three days for a callback or fighting for an appointment slot.

### 🏠 Invisible Service

If you have a keypad or MyQ system, we can complete your maintenance while you're at work. No need to stay home, rearrange your schedule, or meet a technician. This is designed for busy households who don't have bandwidth to manage service appointments.

### 📉 25% Member Discount

Non-wear items—new openers, remotes, decorative hardware, electronics—are discounted 25%. And if you have multiple garage doors, ask about our Estate Discount.

## Who This Is For

Performance Membership is for homeowners who understand the value of **preventive systems over reactive spending**.

If you'd rather pay a predictable monthly fee than deal with a $400 surprise repair at the worst possible time, this makes sense.

If you're tired of remembering to schedule maintenance or wondering whether your door is actually safe, this solves that.

If you value your time and don't want to coordinate service visits, keypad access eliminates that friction entirely.


## How It Works: Certification & Eligibility

Not every door qualifies immediately. Here's what you need to know:

- **Initial Certification Inspection Required:** Your door must pass a Performance Certification Inspection to enroll. This ensures we're starting from a known baseline.
- **Pre-Existing Conditions:** If components are identified as "Poor" or "Failing" during certification, they're not covered until replaced. We're not taking on systems that are already compromised.
- **12-Month Minimum Commitment:** Early cancellation results in billing for provided parts/labor at retail rates. This is a care program, not a month-to-month discount card.
- **Exclusivity Clause:** If another company services your door, the membership is void. We can't guarantee performance if we're not the only ones working on the system.

### What's Not Covered

Performance Membership covers *wear*, not *damage*. That means:

- Forced operation, impact, obstruction, or abuse
- Door panels, tracks, opener motor/rail assemblies
- Cosmetic issues, rust, environmental corrosion
- Structural aging of the door itself

Membership applies **per door**. If you have multiple doors, each requires its own membership (though Estate Discounts apply).

**Selling your home?** The membership is fully transferable, which adds value for the next homeowner and can be a selling point in your listing.

## The Real Benefit: You Stop Thinking About It

Most homeowners never think about their garage door until it fails.

**Performance Members never experience that failure.**

Not because doors don't break—they do. But because the failure is caught, documented, and resolved before it becomes an emergency. The spring that's starting to fatigue gets flagged during inspection and replaced on schedule. The roller that's cracking gets swapped before it seizes. The cable that's fraying gets addressed before it snaps.

You're not just buying parts coverage. You're buying **systematic prevention**.

And when something *does* go wrong between visits, you're not scrambling. You text. You get priority. It gets handled.

## Why This Model Works

Traditional garage door service operates on a break-fix model. Companies make money when things fail. There's no financial incentive to keep your door running smoothly—in fact, the worse it gets, the more they earn.

Performance Membership inverts that. We make money by keeping your door working. Our incentive is aligned with yours: fewer failures, longer component life, predictable performance.

It's the same model that works for HVAC maintenance contracts, dental cleanings, and oil changes. Routine care costs less than emergency repair, and it extends the life of the system.

The difference here is that we've structured it so the *expensive failures* are also covered. You're not just getting inspections—you're getting full parts and labor for the components that actually break.

## The Bottom Line

$49/month is $588/year.

One spring replacement runs $300–$400. Add a service call, a broken roller, a frayed cable, and you're already past break-even in year one.

But the real value isn't just cost savings. It's **never dealing with a failure at an inconvenient time**. It's **not having to think about your garage door**. It's **knowing someone is actively managing the system so you don't have to**.

Most homeowners don't realize how much mental space they give to low-level worries. *Is that noise normal? Should I get that looked at? When was the last time someone serviced this?*

Performance Members don't have those questions. The system is handled.
