# 5 Simple DIY Garage Door Maintenance Tips

Your garage door is the largest moving part of your home-and one of the hardest working. With regular use, it's easy to overlook small issues that can turn into big problems. But with just a little attention a few times a year, you can keep your door running smoothly and avoid unnecessary repairs.

Here are five simple maintenance tips every homeowner should know:

---

## 1. **Look and Listen**

Every time your garage door opens or closes, take a few seconds to observe how it moves and sounds. Does it feel jerky or uneven? Is it making grinding, scraping, or squeaking noises? These are early warning signs that something might be off.

---

## 2. **Tighten the Hardware**

With time and vibration, nuts and bolts can loosen. Using a socket wrench, inspect and tighten the bolts on the door and track system. **Always disconnect the opener and follow safety precautions** before working on your door.

---

## 3. **Lubricate Moving Parts**

Apply a high-quality **garage door lubricant** to the rollers, hinges, and tracks. This reduces friction and wear, helping your system run quieter and last longer. A quick spray every 4-6 months goes a long way.

---

## 4. **Check the Balance**

Disconnect the opener by pulling the release cord (usually a red handle), then manually lift the door halfway. It should stay in place. If it falls or shoots up, the **spring tension may be off**, which is a safety hazard. This is a job for a professional-**never attempt to adjust springs yourself.**

---

## 5. **Test the Safety Features**

If you have an automatic opener, test the **auto-reverse** by placing a block of wood under the door. It should reverse when it touches the object. Also, check the **photo-eye sensors** (near the floor on both sides)-make sure they're aligned and clean.

---

## Bonus Tip: Schedule a Pro Inspection

Even with regular upkeep, it's smart to have a trained technician inspect your system once a year. We can spot signs of wear, test tension, and ensure everything's working safely and efficiently.
