# Is Your Garage Door Stuck? Here's What to Check Before Calling for Help

If you're standing in your driveway on a cold central Michigan morning and your garage door refuses to budge, you're not alone. Garage door issues are one of the most common problems homeowners face, especially during our harsh winters when temperatures can wreak havoc on mechanical systems. Before you call for professional service, there are several things you can check yourself that might get your door moving again.

## 1. Check the Power Source

It might sound obvious, but the first thing to verify is whether your garage door opener has power. Look for these signs:

- Is the opener's light working?
- Check if the outlet has power by plugging in another device
- Look at your home's circuit breaker panel for any tripped breakers
- Ensure the opener is plugged in securely (power cords can get knocked loose)

In central Michigan, winter storms can cause power fluctuations that trip breakers, so this is always worth checking first.

## 2. Inspect the Remote and Wall Switch

If the opener has power but nothing happens when you press the button, the problem might be with your remote or wall switch:

- **Remote batteries**: Replace them and try again
- **Wall switch**: Test if the door opens from the wall button but not the remote
- **Lock mode**: Many openers have a "vacation lock" feature that disables remotes—check if this was accidentally activated
- **Range issues**: Cold weather can affect battery performance and remote range

## 3. Look at the Door Tracks

Visually inspect the metal tracks on both sides of your door:

- Are they aligned properly?
- Is there any visible damage, dents, or bends?
- Are there obstructions like ice, dirt, or debris? (Common in Michigan winters!)
- Check if the tracks are loose from the wall

Misaligned or damaged tracks can prevent your door from moving smoothly or cause it to get stuck partway.

## 4. Examine the Springs

**Warning**: Garage door springs are under extreme tension and can be dangerous. Only look—don't touch or attempt repairs yourself.

Broken springs are one of the most common reasons garage doors won't open:

- **Torsion springs** (mounted above the door): Look for a gap in the spring coil
- **Extension springs** (along the tracks): Check if they appear stretched out or broken
- Listen for a loud bang: If you heard this before your door stopped working, it was likely a spring breaking

Our Michigan climate with its temperature swings puts extra stress on springs, causing them to wear out faster than in milder climates.

## 5. Check the Safety Sensors

Modern garage doors have safety sensors near the floor on each side of the door opening:

- Are the sensor lights on? (Usually green or red)
- Are they aligned with each other?
- Is anything blocking the sensor beam?
- Are the lenses clean and free of dirt, cobwebs, or ice?
- Check if the wiring is damaged or disconnected

Misaligned or blocked sensors will prevent the door from closing, and in some cases, from opening as well.

## 6. Inspect the Cables

Look at the cables that run along the sides of your door:

- Are they frayed, damaged, or broken?
- Have they come off the drums at the top corners of the door?

**Important**: Like springs, cables are under high tension. If you see damage, do not attempt to fix them yourself.

## 7. Test the Manual Release

Try using the manual release cord (usually a red handle hanging from the opener):

- Pull the release and try to manually lift the door
- If it moves easily, the problem is with the opener
- If it's extremely heavy or won't move, you likely have a broken spring
- If it's difficult but moves, the door may be binding in the tracks

## 8. Look for Ice and Weather-Related Issues

Central Michigan winters bring unique challenges:

- **Frozen to the ground**: Ice can seal your door to the driveway—use a heat source to melt the ice carefully
- **Ice in tracks**: Check for ice buildup that could be blocking movement
- **Lubricant thickening**: Cold weather can make lubricants stiff—this usually resolves as the day warms up
- **Weather seal freezing**: The rubber seal at the bottom can freeze to the concrete

## 9. Check for Obstructions

Sometimes the simplest explanation is correct:

- Is something blocking the door's path?
- Are there items stored too close to the door?
- Has snow or ice accumulated that's preventing movement?

## 10. Listen for the Opener Motor

When you press the button, what do you hear?

- **Nothing**: Power or remote issue
- **Motor running but door not moving**: Likely a broken spring or disconnected chain/belt
- **Grinding or straining sounds**: Possible track misalignment or damaged rollers
- **Clicking sounds**: Could indicate a capacitor issue in the opener

## When to Call a Professional

While these checks can help you identify simple issues, some problems require professional attention. You should call a garage door technician if you find:
