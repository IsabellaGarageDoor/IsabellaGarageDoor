# 5 Signs Your Door May Need Attention  

---


Your garage door is likely the largest moving object in your home. It's used multiple times daily but often goes unnoticed - until something goes wrong. At Isabella Garage Door, we believe that understanding when your garage door needs professional attention isn't just about convenience; it's about safety for you and your family.

## Why Garage Door Maintenance Matters

A properly functioning garage door protects your home from intruders and harsh weather conditions while providing convenient access to your property. However, when neglected, garage doors can become safety hazards. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, thousands of injuries occur annually due to garage door malfunctions.

## 5 Warning Signs You Shouldn't Ignore

### 1. Unusual Noises During Operation

Is your garage door suddenly making grinding, scraping, or squeaking noises? These sounds aren't just annoying - they're your door's way of telling you something's wrong. Common causes include:

- Worn-out rollers needing lubrication
- Loose hardware that requires tightening
- Damaged springs or cables under tension

Don't wait until a minor noise becomes a major breakdown. Our technicians can identify the source and provide appropriate solutions before more extensive damage occurs.

### 2. Slow or Uneven Movement

A properly functioning garage door should open and close smoothly and at a consistent speed. If your door hesitates, jerks, or moves unevenly, this could indicate:

- Problems with the track alignment
- Issues with the opener motor
- Broken springs creating imbalance

These problems won't resolve themselves and typically worsen over time, potentially leading to complete system failure.

### 3. The Door Won't Stay Open or Closed

A garage door that won't stay in place is more than an inconvenience-it's a serious safety concern. This issue often points to:

- Broken tension springs
- Problems with the opener's limit settings
- Misaligned safety sensors

Our professional technicians can diagnose and repair these issues quickly, restoring both functionality and peace of mind.

### 4. Visible Damage or Wear

Take a moment to visually inspect your garage door and its components. Look for:

- Bent or damaged sections on the door itself
- Frayed cables or visible wear
- Rust on springs, hinges, or tracks
- Cracked or broken rollers

Even minor visible damage can compromise your door's structural integrity and safety features.

### 5. Increased Energy Bills

Has your electric bill mysteriously increased? Your garage door could be the culprit. An inefficient door forces your opener to work harder, consuming more electricity. Additionally, gaps in weatherstripping allow outside air to enter, making your HVAC system work overtime.

## When DIY Isn't Enough

While some minor maintenance tasks can be handled by homeowners (like lubricating moving parts or tightening loose screws), most garage door repairs require professional expertise. This is especially true for components under high tension, like springs and cables, which can cause serious injury when improperly handled.
