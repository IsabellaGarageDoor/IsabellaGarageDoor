    <p>Broken springs are one of the most common-and dangerous-garage door problems. These tightly wound coils bear the full weight of your door, and when they snap, your door may become heavy, uneven, or completely immobile. Attempting to fix a spring yourself can lead to serious injury, so it's best to call a professional. At Isabella Garage Door, we safely replace broken torsion and extension springs using high-quality parts to restore smooth, reliable operation.
